	<h1>Midburry</h1>
	<hr>
	<h2 id="Point1">Description</h2>
	<p>
	Midburry is a town full of hardened and worn down people. The town is routinely raided by monsters like goblins, orcs, and even occasionally a monster known only as <a href="../../Characters/Villains/Dorkuraz.html">“Dorkuraz”</a>. All throughout the town are blue masks with horns and angry eyes, lots of holly berries covering the buildings, and the streets of the town are covered in soybeans. Dorkuraz is not harmed by any of these, but will pretend to be to keep the illusion of hope alive in the town. There is also a wood elf druid who lives outside the town named Laeroth Oladan, who guards the town at night from various creatures that emerge and try to attack the village. Laeroth knows Dorkuraz well, and sees him as an adversary in an ongoing game of wits. Laeroth knows he can’t kill Dorkuraz alone, or not without extra complications in the game. Dorkuraz knows that Laeroth will protect the village at all costs and tries to avoid him, not because he is scared, but he wants to see how long he can keep the game going before Laeroth gives in and fights him head on, a fight that Dorkuraz would surely win.
	</p>
	<hr>
	<h2 id="Point2">Defenses</h2>
	<p>
	Groups of armed guards regularly patrol the town in pairs of 2. There are 4 guards per district and there are 5 districts, for a total of 20 guards in the city. There is also 1 male elf druid who lives outside the town walls and protects the town from the threats that lurk in the Oak grove. His name is Laeroth Oladan. Also <a href="../../Characters/NPCs/Apostolies.html">Apostolies</a> and his battalion of 6 guards occasionally visit the city for routine inspection and status updates on the town’s money and crime.
	</p>
	<hr>
	<h2 id="Point3">Notable Areas</h2>
	<h3 id="Point4">Church of Etyx</h3>
	<p>
	The priest at the church doesn’t know any spells. His name is <a href="../../Characters/Party/Kilros.html">Kilros</a>, and he is a male tiefling. Tiefling priests are a rarity, because tieflings are destined to go to hell due to their devilish blood. Kilros is a priest for Etyx because he is running an experiment: He wants to see if a tiefling does enough good in its life, and it worships a good aligned god, if they can go to heaven after life. At the beginning of each week he opens the church doors to everyone, and allows people to talk about life problems, confess sins, donate to the church, or do any business they really need to do. Kilros is currently trying to find someone else to run the church instead of him so he can give up on his dreams and simply see the results of the experiment. When the players arrive in the town he will desperately try to get one of the players to take over running the church for him, especially if they are a cleric, paladin, or worshipper of Etyx.

	<h3 id="Point5">Gregory's Great Stables</h3>
	<p>
	At the stables are several horses available for sale. The owner of the stables is a strong human named Gregory. He has mutton chops and is bald. He sells the following horses:
	<ul>
	<li>Greenstrider (Female)<br>
	Greenstrider is a brown horse with white spots and a white tail. She costs 50 gold and has a speed of 40 ft. Greenstrider loves elves and other fey related creatures and refuses to be ridden by tieflings, dragonborn, or dwarves. If a creature she doesn’t want riding her mounts they must make a DC 13 Strength check to stay on. Eventually after 1 minute she will give up and let the creature on her ride her. If a rider wants a good first impression with her they can make a DC 13 Animal handling check.
	</li><br>
	<li>Dale (Male)<br>
	Dale is a dark brown horse with a black tail. He costs 80 gold and has a movement speed of 50 ft. Dale was a professionally bred horse. He comes from a line of horses notorious for their speed. Gregory got him while he was in a big city. He is prideful and kind of a show off, but most of all he isn’t scared. If a gap needs to be jumped he’s the horse to do it. He doesn’t like running in the rain however and will only go at 30 ft in rain. If a rider wants a good first impression with him they can make a DC 14 Animal handling check.
	</li><br>
	<li>Charlie (Male)<br>
	Charlie is a light brown horse. He is very strong and has a strength score of 17, giving him an above average carrying of 600. He is rough and irritable, and doesn't like things getting in his way. He isn’t against making a relationship with someone, but it might be a little bit harder to bond with him than other horses, and even still that relationship is a give and take one. If a rider wants a good first impression with him they can make a DC 15 Animal handling check.
	</li><br>
	<li>Domino (Female)<br>
	Domino is a black horse with long with white spots. She costs 65 gold and has a speed of 40 ft. Domino enjoys being in the company of people and is more inclined to be friendly to Humans, Elves, and Halflings. Domino isn’t scared of combat, and can manage it, but doesn’t enjoy it, and will flee immediately as soon as something damages her or maybe even her rider. If a rider wants a good first impression with her they can make a DC 12 Animal handling check. Humans, Elves, and Halflings get a +3 bonus to the roll.
	</li><br>
	<li>Spirit (Male)<br>
	Spirit is a grey horse with yellow eyes. Spirit’s origins are mysterious and Gregory says that he found him outside his shop wandering around in the town at night. Nobody owned it so he just took it in. Spirit costs 50 gold and has a movement speed of 40 feet. Spirit has no fondness towards any particular race, and making a meaningful relationship with it will be hard. He doesn’t refuse to be ridden, but it won’t go out of its way to do anything meaningful for the rider. Spirit is actually the horse that Dorkuraz used to ride, but lost after Spirit ran away. Spirit will fight to the death for anyone if in that current situation they are fighting Dorkuraz. She greatly dislikes him, and killing Dorkuraz is a way to earn the horse’s trust. If a rider wants a good first impression with her they can make a DC 18 Animal handling check.
	</li><br>
	<li>Pale Pete (Male)<br>
	Pale Pete is an old frail white horse. Gregory knows that almost nobody is willing to buy him, so he sells him extremely cheaply. Pale Pete costs 25 gold and has a speed of 30 ft. Pale Pete really just doesn’t care that much anymore, and is mostly just waiting out his last years in a somber sadness knowing that the day he dies he will be rotting away in this old stable. Gregory feels especially bad for the horse and through some bargaining would definitely give it away for 10 gold at a minimum. If a rider wants a good first impression with him they can make a DC 13 Animal handling check.
	</ul>
	</p>
	
	<h3 id="Point6">The Silver Stagg Inn</h3>
	<p>
	The Silver Stag Inn is a 4 story tavern. The bottom floor is the reception area and dining area. Players can get food and drink here. The tavern also allows room stays and has 14 rooms.
	<br>
	The tavern is run by a human named Edison Ashe. He is an old man who used to be an adventurer but then decided to settle down and start a tavern. On the wall of the first floor of the tavern is a skull of a stag with silver horns. If asked about it he will say, 

	<blockquote><i>"It was one of the most deadly monsters he fought that beast. It's a creature that lives in the deepest and darkest parts of the hazy forest just outside of lighthold. A creature called the Gaeridon. It was a celestial creature, or it used to be. The Gaeridon committed a terrible crime against the gods and were punished. Just the sight of it was terrifying on it’s own, much more with the dark words and secrets it uttered. That creature made me fear the forest for a while until I got over it. I specifically keep this skull in the tavern because there are rumors that if an evil presence steps near it, the skull absorbs it. It also has the added bonus of warding off any other Gaeridons if any are lurking in the area."</i></blockquote>
