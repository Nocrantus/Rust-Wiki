	<h1>About The Player</h1>
	<p>Malvur was played by Noah Levinson, the creator of this website. Malvur is Noah’s second ever DnD character, but easily his favorite. Since then, Noah has had an unhealthy obsession with dwarves, partially because of Malvur and partially because of his favorite game, Deep Rock Galactic.</p>
	<h1>Backstory</h1>
	<h2>Early Life</h2>
	<p>
	Malvur was born the son of one of the most famous dwarves in recent history, Hugrit Granitejaw, the man who wrote the Book of Etyx and was Etyx’s most devout follower in life. Malvur was raised by his father and mother, who also happens to be a legendary paladin in her own right. It only made sense that he would craft a legendary legacy of his own.
	</p>
	<h2>Early Adulthood</h2>
	<p>
	When Malvur was 40 years old, his father was assigned by Bigby Thatcher to serve as a double agent to Daggershine, specifically to investigate any occult proceedings given his divine history. At the same time, Malvur began his studies on the wonders of healing and medicine. He became a skilled surgeon and doctor, serving in the Snakevein hospital during his time as a doctor.
	</p>
	<p>
	20 years later, Malvur was admitted a patient who had undergone serious damage. His body was mutilated and destroyed, but he was still alive. After working his hardest to repair his patient, Malvur discovered the source. The patient’s body was constantly being ravaged by a dark, evil form of magic. Malvur had never studied how to work with magic, and only knew the conventional means of healing. With no options left, Malvur prayed. He got down on his hands and knees, and begged Etyx with all his might to cure this man. After a moment of nothing, Malvur felt a surge of divine healing power course through his body. Not knowing what he was doing, he casted “Cure Wounds” on the patient. Almost instantly, the patient was completely healed.
	</p>
	<p>
	10 years following Malvur’s discovery of magic, his father, Hugrit, was revealed to be a double agent, and was kidnapped by Tamelia Altaria of Daggershine. She demanded a ransom of 20,000 gold pieces, and gave the Granitejaws a 50 year deadline. Filled with rage, Malvur’s mother went on her own quest to find Tamelia and free her husband. In the meantime, Malvur quit his job as a doctor and began his long life of adventuring to earn his father’s ransom.
	</p>
	<p>
	50 years later, the deadline was about to run out. Malvur had barely gotten much money in that time, and was just trying to run away from Tamelia. He chose the small, desolate town of Ambermeadow to be his temporary hideout. While traveling to Ambermeadow, he met a warforged. They introduced themselves, and hopped into a wagon together. From there, the story begins.

	<h1>Game Summary</h1>
	<p>
	At first their journeys were rather ordinary, but things took a sudden turn when a conspiracy began to unravel before his eyes. It seemed as if the ancient dragon known as Iknyr had returned. He was presumed dead for nearly 5,000 years, but upon learning of his return Malvur and his friends began their quest to slay this legendary dragon. Along the way they met the young tiefling man Kilros and had him join their quest. They also came face to face with the young dragon Kystraz, who after some hard deliberation was convinced to betray Iknyr and help them.	
	</p>
	<p>
	These two men were going down dark paths before Malvur had changed their lives. Kilos struggled severely with mental health and his nihilistic thoughts, and Kystraz served Iknyr before realizing that he was fighting for the wrong side. Kilros chose to become a hero to achieve salvation from his ultimate fate, as unless a god directly intervened, Kilos would have gone to Hell, as all tieflings are sent to Hell for their devilish heritage. Kystraz felt that most of what he didn’t wouldn’t matter, as dragons like him were typically looked down upon as villains, but after being shown kindness from Malvur, Kystraz realized that he wasn’t defined by the color of his scales, and that he could be the change he wanted to see in the world. Kilos and Kystraz both became good friends of Malvur, but eventually Kilos returned to his home after feeling he had done his part. Though Kystraz still felt he had unfinished business with Iknyr, and continued to help Malvur on his quest. Soon enough Malvur grew from the local hero of Ambermeadow to the legendary warrior who would be chosen to defend Favanu from the threat of Iknyr, the Red Lord. Through many trials and tribulations he grew strong enough to stand up to such an overwhelmingly powerful force.
	</p>
	<p>
	Although he and his friends faced Iknyr several times, they only ever beat him once with the help of the Council of Dragons. However, near the end of his many journeys Malvur decided to follow in his father’s footsteps and make his mark on history by slaying the dreaded dragon once and for all, returning peace to the Favanish Empire. They descended into the depths of Hell itself to end Iknyr, and returned home honored as legendary heroes. After his journeys Malvur would retire to Snakevein to live the rest of his many days a happy man knowing he lived up to his father’s legacy.
